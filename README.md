## Mobile Pentest Area of analysis:

1. Mobile forensics and data recovery
2. Network, web services and API testing
3. Server-side penetration testing
4. Reverse engineering and code analysis


## Mobile data at REST
a) Where can be found:
- Private application folder - folder that created when installing apps
- SD card - another storage for android
- system log files - generated for application logs and the device its self including the debugging
- keychain - IFP chain store sensitive data
- ram - temp stored data
- source code(hardcoded) - sensitive password and other values inside the code itself
- web cache/history(hybrid/web-wrapper apps) - have data store on browser

b) Tools for data recovery and analysis:

`File system`
Android -- debug bridge("adb pull" command)
iOS -- libimobiledevice

`System Log Files`
Android -- logcat command-line-tool
iOS -- Syslog (instruction for non-developers)

`iOS Keychain`
iOS Keychain analyzer

`RAM`
Android -- Android debug bridge("adb dumpsys meminfo")
iOS -- heapdump-ios

## 1. Mobile forensics and data recovery

<h2>Android</h2>

`a) locate your app(adb) `
```
adb shell		//access the device shell
cd data/data	//locate the app data directory
ls				//find the app private directory
```

`b) pull app data off phone`
```
adb pull data/data/com/anydo AnyDo	//adb pull <data-path-source> <destination>
```

`c) Analyze app data`
```
sqliteman - see stored data
```

<h2>iOS</h2>

`a) locate your app(adb)`

#App bundle data location:
```
cd /private/var/mobile/Containers/
ls
```

#App bundle location:
```
cd Application/
ls
```

#App data locations:
```
cd Application/
ls
```

#Sort  by most recently installed:
```
ls -lat
```

#change directory to the latest app(the one you just installed for testing):
```
cd 983FCV4-........./
cd Library/Preferences/
ls
```

#make note of full path from previous step:
```
/private/var/mobile/Containers/Application/983FCV4-........./(for example)
```

#Scp command to copy file from app folder:
```
~/Desktop scp -r root@192.168.xx.xx://private/var/mobile/Containers/Application/983FCV4-......... App-Files/
```

`b)Analyze the file`
1. SQLite database
2. plist
3. xml files
4. Look for data stored as common hashes/encoding(base64,md5,sha256,etc)
5. when searching for data in large files, command line tools are best: try grep
6. don't limit yourself: explore storage locations from common one
7. iOS app use the "Cache.db" file, which often large amount of data
